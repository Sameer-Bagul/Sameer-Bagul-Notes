# 🚀 **Study Material Hub** 📚  
**Curated Notes by a Programmer for Programmers**

---

## 👋 **Introduction**  
Welcome to **Study Material Hub**, a platform where I, a passionate programmer and learner, bring together all my knowledge and insights. Over the years, I’ve accumulated deep understanding and experience in various fields such as:  

- **Data Structures & Algorithms** (DSA)  
- **Machine Learning** (ML)  
- **Application Development**  
- **Web Development**  
- **Blockchain Technology**  
- ...and many more!  
- I am Adding more topics as I learn them...!!!

To keep track of my journey, I’ve crafted **detailed notes** for each of these topics in markdown format, and this project serves as a structured platform to share those notes with learners like you.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**  

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. **Project Setup**  
Initialize the project with Vite:  
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-study-hub -- --template react
cd my-study-hub
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**  
Install Tailwind CSS and other required packages:  
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
npm install react-router-dom
```

### 3. **Configure Tailwind CSS**  
Edit `tailwind.config.js` for proper setup:  
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Add Tailwind to your `index.css`:  
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### 4. **Create Folder Structure**  
Run the following commands:  
```bash
mkdir -p src/components src/pages src/notes/dsa src/notes/ml
touch src/components/SubjectCards.jsx src/components/MarkdownRenderer.jsx
touch src/pages/HomePage.jsx src/pages/SubjectIntro.jsx src/pages/NotesPage.jsx
touch src/notes/dsa/intro.md src/notes/ml/intro.md
```

### 5. **Start Development Server**
